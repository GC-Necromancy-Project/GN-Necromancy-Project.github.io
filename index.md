The Google Code Necromancy Project is a community effort to salvage interesting projects found on the Google Code Archive and reviving these by mirroring repositories to GitHub.

## What was Google Code anyway?

Google is a company which has been [a long advocate of open-source](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2008/02/welcome-to-google-open-source-blog.html). Well before [Google's Organization on GitHub](https://github.com/google/), in fact even before GitHub itself, there was [Google Code](https://code.google.com/), a host for thousands of open-source repositories, including a ton of Google's own in-house projects.

Alas, Google Code [was closed down in early 2016](https://code.google.com/archive/), cutting off further development on over one million projects. While some of these projects were migrated to GitHub or other hosts, the vast majority of them now lay dormant in the [Google Code Archive](https://code.google.com/archive/d/code.google.com).

## How it's Done

GCA projects are mirrored to [the GCNP Organization](https://github.com/GCNP). For preservation's sake, the original repository is minimally modified; license, version control artifacts and original authors are kept intact where available. A `readme.md` might be added for readability.

If you are interested in actively developing a project we have mirrored, please fork!
